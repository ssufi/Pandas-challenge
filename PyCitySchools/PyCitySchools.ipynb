The district, comprised of 15 schools and 39,170 students, shows an average math score of 78.99 and reading score of 81.88, with an overall passing rate of 65.17%. Charter schools consistently outperform district schools, with top-performing schools including Cabrera, Thomas, Griffin, Wilson, and Pena. On the other hand, bottom-performing schools like Rodriguez, Figueroa, Huang, Hernandez, and Johnson exhibit lower passing rates. \n",

    "From the analysis, we can assume that charter schools outperform district schools in both average math and reading scores as well as overall passing rates. This couldpossibly mean that charter schools have higher academic success as compared to the district schools. \n",
    "\n",
    "The sizing of school also plays a role in academic success. For example, smaller-sized schools had higher averaged math and reading scores, as well as better overall passing rates. This is in comparison to larger schools. This is helpful for educational policymakers who are working on how to strategize to improve academic success in schools. "
